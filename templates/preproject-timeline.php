<ol>
	<li>You'll fill out the questionnaire below introducing yourself and your project to me.</li>
	<li>I'll review and follow up with my availability to grab coffee either in person (if we're in the same city) or via Skype.</li>
	<li>We get to know each other.  I'll ask you questions to find out what makes you tick, what drives your business, and to explore the project at hand. I expect you to have a few questions of your own.</li>
	<li>Based on our conversation, I'll follow up with a proposed project scope, timeline, and cost.</li>
	<li>If necessary, we'll review and I'll answer any questions you have regarding the proposal.</li>
	<li>We both accept the proposal.</li>
	<li>We both sign a working agreement.</li>
	<li>You make a payment of 1/3 the agreed project total cost.</li>
	<li>We schedule project kickoff. I schedule strictly on a first come, first serve basis.</li>
	<li>Your project begins on the date scheduled.</li>
