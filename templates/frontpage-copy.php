<p>It's people of all walks of life who use the web every day, and I keep this at the forefront of every decision I make. How will this feature, design, experience affect the people who'll be using this site? Who are those people and what do we know about them?</p>

<p>My work is driven by collaboration, an inquisitive nature, and some good ol’ fashioned elbow grease. With these three pillars (and over five years full-time freelance experience), I'm able to create thoughtful, holistic design solutions that get out of the way to allow people to accomplish what they need to.</p>

Right now you can <a class="link" href="<?= esc_url(home_url('/follow-along')); ?>" tltle="">follow me treking around the globe</a>, reading under a tree, or enjoying the day in a new cafe.</p>
