## Colophon

This [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) site was hand coded by [Justin Chick](http://justinchick.com) at [TechArtista](http://techartista.org) while in [St. Louis, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis) using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Chassis](http://chassis.io/), and a [15 inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP704?locale=en_US).

I used the [Sage Starter Theme](https://github.com/roots/sage) (v8.2.1) as a jumping off point which uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage development dependencies, [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage front-end packages, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automate the build process.

[Bootstrap Sass Official](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) (v3.3.5) is the front-end framework, however, I’m using [Flexbox Grid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid) rather than Bootstrap v3’s default float based grid. Buttons are provided by my [button module](https://github.com/jchck/jchck-btn) and white space utilities are provided by my [whitespace module](https://github.com/jchck/jchck-spacing).

Off-canvas navigation is provided by [https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-panels](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-panels), image zooming is handled by [zoom.js](https://github.com/fat/zoom.js) (which has a dependency of [Bootstraps transition.js](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/transition.js)), my latest Instagram shots are pulled in using [Instafeed.js](https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js), and I wrote a little bit of [JavaScript to handle smooth scrolling](https://github.com/jchck/jchck_/blob/master/assets/scripts/main.js#L55-L69) on the Hire Me page.
